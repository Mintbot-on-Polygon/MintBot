# MintBot : Mint NFTs directly via Telegram

This bot allows anyone to create an NFT directly from their telegram app. To get started, open the [bot](https://t.me/nftmintbot) and click /start.

To mint, simply attach an image to a message and include a caption in the following format. <address> : <name/title> : <description>
The NFTs are minted on Polygon (an Ethereum layer 2 network) and the bot covers the gas costs.

On successful minting, your NFTs will be visible on marketplaces (which support Polygon) such as Opensea.
