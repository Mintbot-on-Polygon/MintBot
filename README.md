# Mintbot : Gas free ENS subdomains via Twitter

Mintbot started out as a service that allows ENS Domain holders to create collections for free and mint NFTs directly from their Telegram account.

The service has since expanded to provide free & gas-less ENS subdomains via Twitter. Gas-less registrations are achieved through CCIP Read and Offchain resolution (same technology utilized by coinbase with their free cb .id subdomains). The names can be resolved via rainbow wallet, coinbase wallet, trust wallet & Metamask.

To mint, simply attach an image to a message and include a caption in the following format. 

```
<address> : <name/title> : <description>
```
The NFTs are minted on [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) (an Ethereum layer 2 network) and the bot covers the gas costs. [ENS domains](https://ens.domains/) are supported.
